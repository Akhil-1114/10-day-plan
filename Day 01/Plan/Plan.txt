Plan

*Provision a Kubernetes cluster locally (Minikube) or on the cloud using modular Terraform*

Modular Terraform Instead of putting all your code in one place, you Split it into small modules â€” each module does one job.

One module builds a network (VPC)

Another builds a server (EC2)

Another creates access (IAM roles)

Then, you connect those modules together in one main file.
